# Spreadsheet Portfolio

Through this repository, I will save and display my personal Google Spreadsheet projects, showcasing as much as I can about my skills in this tool. I really love Spreadsheet since it is similar to Excel. Apart from that, it's easier to access by everyone and doesn't require any installation in PC.

## Objectives
Showcase skills in analyzing and visualizing data using formulas and functions.

This planner is able to show travel expenses in each categories throughout your travel (transportation, accommodation, food, activities, shopping, emergency buffer, and visa), while showcasing whether your travel is still under or over the planned budget. It also shows day countdown until the day of the travel. A pie diagram in the dashboard would also helps in displaying which categories you spend your budget the most. This planner contains five sheets: Dashboard, Calendar (based on the year of the travel), Expenses, Itinerary, and Packing List.
